# Movies-ETL
We refactor the code learned in Module 8 into a more efficient and clear way - in several large functions. 
We excute, transform and load data by cleaning different format, delete dulplicated columns, 
combine columns with similar meanings into one column, delete or combine columns mostly zero, etc. 
And after we finish this process, we load the dataframes into SQL to save them and do furthur analysis.
